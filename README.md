# siglscope
Set of programs for interacting with Siglent SDS 1000 series oscilloscopes in Linux.
Yes, it should compile and run in other Unices too, but it needs usbtmc kernel driver
to do anything useful. For now at least. In other thought, there should be no real
reason for this program not to work over serial.
